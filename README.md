A Spigot/Paper Minecraft plugin that enhances the survival experience.

> This plugin is based on 1.21.x and could potentially break in future versions.

## What is SuperHardcore?
SuperHardcore is designed to turn your average vanilla experience into something that modern-day Minecraft hardcore should be like. For example, this plugin will limit the max health of the player down to a simple 10 hp (5 hearts), limit the maximum amount of damage you deal and receive, and some other quality of life modifications.

## Planned Features
Of course, this is a completely new plugin so it will be lackluster.

1. Limited HP
2. Mobs deal amplified damage
3. Limited dealt damage
4. Naturally spawning charged creeper

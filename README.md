# SuperHardcore
A Spigot/Paper Minecraft plugin that _enhances_ the survival experience.

> [!WARNING]
> Experimental code ahead! This plugin may cause unintended bugs with other plugins.

## What is SuperHardcore?
SuperHardcore is designed to turn your average vanilla experience into something that modern-day Minecraft hardcore should be like. For example, this plugin will limit the max health of the player down to a simple 6 hp (3 hearts), limit the maximum amount of damage you deal and receive, and some other quality of life modifications.

## Introduced Enhancements
Below are the current enhancements:

1. Limited HP
2. Mobs deal amplified damage
3. Limited dealt damage
4. Naturally spawning charged creeper
5. Increased creeper speed

# SuperHardcore

A Spigot/Paper plugin that makes Minecraft survival **way harder** and more exciting.

> [!WARNING]  
> This is experimental code! It might break other plugins or cause unique bugs. <br>Made for Spigot/Paper Minecraft
> 1.21.x. This might work in future versions, but not tested.

## What does SuperHardcore do?

It changes vanilla Minecraft to feel like true modern hardcore survival should feel: hazardous, very tense, no easy
mode.

You start with only **4 hearts** and mobs hit **much harder**. Players deal less damage. And some mobs got scary
upgrades.

## Changes this plugin makes

- Players only have **8 max health** (4 hearts)
    - Players will see they have "full" health, but they truly have 8 health points
- Monsters deal **3× more damage** to players
- Players deal only **45%** of their normal damage
- Every creeper that spawns is **charged**
- Creepers move **faster** and almost **no knockback** (good luck punching them away)
- Spiders always get one random strong effect: Speed, Strength, Regeneration, or Invisibility (level 2, forever)
- Skeletons **don't burn** in daylight anymore
- Endermen **don't take damage** from water / rain
- Shields now allow 25% of the blocked incoming damage to go through and damage you

## How to install
